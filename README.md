# My D&D Campaign Hub Website
This GatsbyJs website project is for my players to view information about the campaign world, its locations, NPCs, and past sessions.

It takes the markdown files from Obsidian vault that I use for my notes and builds the web pages I want to make available to my players.

## Entities
The following entities are defined in this project and have relationships to other entities which are used to build the campaign pages. All entities are defined in `src/entity.config.ts` along with the include and exclude rules to identify what entity a note is.

### Campaign

### World

### Party

### Session

### NPC
